The Document Object Model

What is the DOM?  The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document 
as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure.

The DOM is not actually part of JavaScript because it islanguage agnostic(although 
JavaScript is, by far, the language most commonly used with it). This means it can
be used in any programming language, not just JavaScript. We can use JavaScript to 
access and modify different parts of a web page using a special built-in object called document .

An Example Web Page
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Justice League</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
    <h1 id='title'>Justice League</h1>
    </header>
    <ul id='roster'>
    <li class='hero'>Superman</li>
    <li class='vigilante hero' id='bats'>Batman</li>
    <li class='hero'>Wonder Woman</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>


check out notes from group assignment and see all the 
different ways to filter through an array.
array.prototype.filter()
array.prototype.map()
array.prototype.sort()
array.prototype.reduce()
array.prototype.some()
array.prototype.every()


Quesions:  Is there one way that is better than the other when displaying an array in either a table or log?
