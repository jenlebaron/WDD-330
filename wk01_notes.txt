Rewiring Your Brain for a Mobile First Experience

“If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality.  That leads to simple, beautiful apps”

Responsive retrofitting
•	Cheaper and faster than ground up re-write
•	Better mobile experience than desktop only
•	Doesn’t address screen real estate issues
•	Doesn’t address touch interaction issues

Mobile first
•	Time consuming and costly for a full rebuild
•	Provided best experience across many devices
•	Addresses constraints of mobile size/bandwidth
•	Future friendly and ready for growth

Things to remember about rewiring our brains
•	Desktop Computer Sales have been declining since 2011
•	You don’t see people with their heads in laptops
•	Start small ad scale up
•	Mobile is not a fad

How to improve Mobile UX by Understanding Users

“It’s really hard to design products by focus groups.  A lot of the times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” ~ Steve Jobs

Immediate-Be There
•	To help move someone along their decision journey, and deepen their loyalty
Relevant-Be Useful
•	Only 9% of users will stay if it doesn’t satisfy their needs
Frictionless-Be Quick
•	It’s not just about fast loading, the functionality must be there as well
Reachability Matters
•	Put buttons where they are easy to get to on a mobile device 
Speed Matters
•	If your stuff is loading quickly people will stay
•	Not everybody has the latest and greatest
o	Reduce images usage throughout sties/apps
o	SVG/webfonts are lower bandwith
o	Optimize and minify css and js files
o	Gzip files to eliminate unnecessary data

Better Mobile UX through Strategic Menu Design

“The trouble with software is…it sucks.  That’s not a nice thing to say…but it is a fundamental truth.  Software customers – you, me, CIOs of multibillion-dollar companies…have learned to live with mediocre software.  We do not count on software to be intuitively easy to understand or to work consistently.  Instead, we make do.”

Put the menu at the bottom so it is easier to reach
Make users happy so they stay and use your app

Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms

“The constraints of Mobile push you toward more focused, simplified solutions.  You can only fit so much on the screen, people often have to wait for it, and they’re unlikely to give you their full attention.  So, make it easy to understand and use and focus on the important things first.  Mobile is a great forcing function for simplicity”

Buy putting only the information needed
Have the labels inside the field like a float field and make the field slightly taller
Make check boxes bigger
Pagination is good for when you need more information.  Use a progression bar for them to see how much longer is needed
Enabling auto complete on your form

Passwords Matter-show them but let them hide them if they want

Numbers Matter-pace the numbers for easy entry and easy to read.
Give a good keyboard for them to use like the number pad
Phone numbers-don’t force a copy and paste. -Linking phone numbers w=on your website makes it much easier for people to call from mobile devices


Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience

“End-users, not technologies, shape the market.  Consequently, marketers need to say abreast not only of technological developments but also of the way people respond to them.”

Make your ads small and when it is clicked can become larger
Video ads are big these days
Have an ad behind the screen and show a little as a teaser.

Things to Remember
•	Stop using Pop-ups/Pop-overs
•	Users don’t visit your website to look at ads
•	Keep it simple and sleek
•	Make sure it is unobtrusive.  Content first
