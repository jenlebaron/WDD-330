 <!-- 
1.  Take a look at this starter code for a hiking app. It is an example of a small application 
    that takes some data ( in this case an array of objects), and builds out the HTML necessary to 
    display it in the browser. It is simply a collection of functions and variables with no attempt 
    at organization. Since this is a small app we can get away with it, but if it were larger and 
    more complex it could quickly become hard to follow. As complexity increases, code that has no 
    thought towards organization usually turns into 'spaghetti code'.

    Think about how you could use modules, objects, or classes to better organize this code. What 
    modules would you need? What objects would make sense? Discuss this with your group.

    You might start by making a list of all of the functions and properties you think you will need 
    (look that the code for a starting point!). Notice also the stretch goals below...make sure your 
    pattern will allow for the stretch goals to be completed as well.

    The process of evaluating code like we are doing to improve it is called refactoring, and is a 
    pretty common practice. Note that the output of the code should not change...it should accomplish 
    the same thing at the end as it did in the beginning. Only the organization and structure of the 
    code should change to make it more portable, maintainable, reusable, etc.

2.  Implement the modules, objects, and/or classes you discussed above to organize the Hikes code. 
    Before you do this, compare your plans with this partial solution file. It has a class with 
    methods stubbed out. How does it differ from your plans? Discuss this with your team. You do not 
    need to implement yours exactly like the example...but make sure you understand why each of the 
    properties, methods, and functions are there before continuing.

    With either your groups ideas or using the partial solution file above, write the rest of the 
    code to make the application work.

    I would recommend a structure similar to the following for your application:

    index.html 
    main.js 
    hikes.js 
    styles.css 

3. Style it.
    Add the CSS required to make your list of hikes match this wireframe.

Stretch Goals
 

1.  Get the details-When we touch a hike it would be good if it showed us the full details for 
    that hike. Make it so. Replace the list of hikes with a detailed view of one hike.

2.  Getting Back to our list-Add a "back" button/link that will take you from the hike details 
    back to the main list.-->
    
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>Great hikes</h1>
      <ul id="hikes" class="hikeStyles">
        <!-- your hike list should be build here. -->
      </ul>
    </main>

    <script src="hiking-start.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
